Chapter 4: Inventory
We remain within the retail industry for the second case study but turn your attention to another business process. This chapter introduces the enterprise data warehouse bus architecture and the bus matrix with conformed dimensions. These
concepts are critical to anyone looking to construct a DW/BI architecture that is
integrated and extensible. We also compare the three fundamental types of fact
tables: transaction, periodic snapshot, and accumulating snapshot.
Chapter 5: Procurement
This chapter reinforces the importance of looking at your organization’s value chain
as you plot your DW/BI environment. We also explore a series of basic and advanced
techniques for handling slowly changing dimension attributes; we’ve built on the
long-standing foundation of type 1 (overwrite), type 2 (add a row), and type 3 (add
a column) as we introduce readers to type 0 and types 4 through 7.Introduction xxxi
Chapter 6: Order Management
In this case study, we look at the business processes that are often the first to be
implemented in DW/BI systems as they supply core business performance metrics—what are we selling to which customers at what price? We discuss dimensions
that play multiple roles within a schema. We also explore the common challenges
modelers face when dealing with order management information, such as header/
line item considerations, multiple currencies or units of measure, and junk dimensions with miscellaneous transaction indicators.
