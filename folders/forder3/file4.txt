Be forewarned that we deviate from the case study approach in Chapter 2: Kimball
Dimensional Modeling Techniques Overview. Given the broad industry acceptance
of the dimensional modeling techniques invented by the Kimball Group, we have
consolidated the official listing of our techniques, along with concise descriptions
and pointers to more detailed coverage and illustrations of these techniques in
subsequent chapters. Although not intended to be read from start to finish like the
other chapters, we feel this technique-centric chapter is a useful reference and can
even serve as a professional checklist for DW/BI designers.
With the exception of Chapter 2, the other chapters of this book build on one
another. We start with basic concepts and introduce more advanced content as the
book unfolds. The chapters should be read in order by every reader. For example, it
might be difficult to comprehend Chapter 16: Insurance, unless you have read the
preceding chapters on retailing, procurement, order management, and customer
relationship management.
Those of you who have read the last edition may be tempted to skip the first
few chapters. Although some of the early fact and dimension grounding may be
familiar turf, we don’t want you to sprint too far ahead. You’ll miss out on updates
to fundamental concepts if you skip ahead too quickly
